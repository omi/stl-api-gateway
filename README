Implementation of OMI API for the Sawtooth Lake OMI Transaction Family.

Configure
---------

Use the OMI_URL environment variable to point the application to the
Sawtooth Lake REST API::

  OMI_URL="http://192.168.100.100:8080"

Run
---

 $ ./setup_venv.sh
 $ ./manage.py runserver

Known Issues
------------

The OMI Transaction Family and OMI API are not completely in sync.
Therefor some fields are moved to the "ext" object in the responses.

Also when writing to the API the Transaction Family requirements must
be satisfied which is not always strictly compatible with the OMI API Specs.
