===============

Implementation of OMI API for the Sawtooth Lake OMI Transaction Family.


Getting Started
---------------

Use the STL_REST_URL environment variable to point the application to the
Sawtooth Lake REST API::

  STL_REST_URL="http://192.168.100.100:8080"

The OMI Transaction Family can be setup using the instruction in the
omi-summer-lab repository.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install these dependencies needed to compile Sawtooth Lake dependencies.

On Debian or Ubuntu Linux:
    $ apt-get install autoconf automake python3 libffi-dev libgmp-dev \
                      libssl-dev pkg-config libtool

On Mac:

    $ xcode-select --install  # (For the xcode command line tools)
    $ brew install autoconf automake python3 libffi libgmp libssl \
                   pkg-config libtool

For more information about these dependencies please look at the file
`sawtooth-core/bin/install_packaging_deps` from Sawtooth Lake.


Setup
~~~~~

 $ ./setup_venv.sh

Run
~~~

 $ source venv3/bin/activate
 $ ./manage.py runserver


Sample Data
-----------

To get some sample data into Sawtooth Lake you can modify the tests in the
omi-summer-lab repository: omi/tests/test_omi_smoke.py

Change the URL to match your endpoint and run the test class with::

    TestOMISmoke().test_omi_smoke()


Known Issues
------------

The OMI Transaction Family and OMI API are not completely in sync.
Some fields have been moved to the "ext" object in the responses.

Also when writing to the API the Transaction Family requirements must
be satisfied which is not always strictly compatible with the OMI API Specs.
